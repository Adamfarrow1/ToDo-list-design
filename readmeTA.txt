I was unaware that we had to sumbit our final sumbission to compile. If you were to run the last submission submitted friday
you can see that my GUI runs fine. I just pushed a working program that compiles just now. As per the other assignments our psuedo
code didnt have to compile so I didn't realize this one would be different.
